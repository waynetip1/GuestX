Guest X Coding Test v.1 
 
Question 1 Our company needs to send out time sensitive and highly personal information to clientele. Information cannot be a savable format at any time. So no emails, faxes, texts, or anything that would leave a paper trail. How would you solve this problem and what technologies would you use? What questions would you ask to further your solution or find a better solution? 
 
Question 2 Represent a 6 string guitar (standard tuning, only the first 2 fret boards) and a 4 string bass (standard tuning, only the first 3 frets) in a class structure. Create attributes, elements, functions and any other components you feel they may have. 
 
1. Consider where they are similar and where they are different. 2. Consider we want to identify if the note from one is equal to the other based on the fret position and string played. 
 
Please note this doesn’t ​need 
​ to be an executable application , only a collection of classes that would represent the guitar , the bass in its commonality and its differences. 
 
Question 3 Let's say you have a list of N+1 integers between 1 and N. You know there's at least one duplicate, but there might be more. For example, if N=3, your list might be 3, 1, 1, 3 or it might be 1, 3, 2, 2. Print out a number that appears in the list more than once. (That is, in the first example, you can print '1' or '3' -- you don't have to print both.) 
 
Program Input: A list of numbers between 0 and N, all integers, comma separated. 
 
Program Output: A list of all numbers that are duplicated in the list. 
 Language: ​Code this using C#. 
 
 
 
 
Question 4 Develop a javascript / browser application that will count the number of words & lines that have more than X vowels for Y words in every Z line. 
 Language: ​Code this using Javascript and build a quick UI with a text box. 
 Example: 
 
Example Parameter: Words: count every [ 3 ] words, Count words with: [2] or more vowels , every [2] lines 
 1. ​I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, 2. and to ​the ​Republic for ​which ​it stands, ​one ​Nation under ​God​, 3. ​indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, should be rendered 4. by standing ​at ​attention facing ​the ​flag with ​the ​right hand ​over 5. ​the heart. When not in uniform men should remove any non-religious 6. headdress with ​their ​right hand ​and ​hold it ​at ​the left ​shoulder​, 7. ​the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain 8. silent, face ​the ​flag, and ​render ​the military ​salute​. 
 Result: ​Red is a non-match  Bold is a match  Grey are non-considered lines) 
 
Screen Output: 
 
Results: Lines: 4, words: 6 
 
Question 5 Our oil and gas client would like an application to track the depletion of their 5 sites. Each site has between 2 and 5 wells and each well extracts oil, natural gas, or a combination of the two. There are many large pieces of equipment that need to be assigned to each well including things like extractors, storage tanks, office buildings, etc. Each well has been analyzed by oil and gas engineers and they can determine the reserves before any drilling starts. Each day the equipment operates, the natural resources are extracted and sent to be refined. Our client will provide the data similar to the tables below.  
 

 
a) Model this data using your favorite modeling tool and populate your model with your own sample/test data. 
 
b) Using the sample / test data and data model you created in 5, create sample visualizations using bootstrap / javascript / css that will allow our client to quickly see current reserves, daily extraction, and forecasting of when wells will run dry.  
 
The visualization does not have to be dynamic or functional; a static layout is fine.
