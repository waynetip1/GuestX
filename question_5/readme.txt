Question 5 Our oil and gas client would like an application to track the depletion of their 5 sites. Each site has between 2 and 5 wells and each well extracts oil, natural gas, or a combination of the two. There are many large pieces of equipment that need to be assigned to each well including things like extractors, storage tanks, office buildings, etc. Each well has been analyzed by oil and gas engineers and they can determine the reserves before any drilling starts. Each day the equipment operates, the natural resources are extracted and sent to be refined. Our client will provide the data similar to the tables below. 

 
 a) Model this data using your favorite modeling tool and populate your model with your own sample/test data. 
 
b) Using the sample / test data and data model you created in 5, create sample visualizations using bootstrap / javascript / css that will allow our client to quickly see current reserves, daily extraction, and forecasting of when wells will run dry.  
 
The visualization does not have to be dynamic or functional; a static layout is fine.
