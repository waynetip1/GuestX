Question 1 Our company needs to send out time sensitive and highly personal information to clientele. Information cannot be a savable format at any time. So no emails, faxes, texts, or anything that would leave a paper trail. How would you solve this problem and what technologies would you use? What questions would you ask to further your solution or find a better solution?

The sharing of confidential information in a responsible manner is a critical organizational responsibility. However, striking the right balance between security, convenience, and tracking is challenging.  Nevertheless, the specification that information cannot be in a savable format at any time, and documents are time sensitive are clear requirements that help limit possible solutions.
My solution would be a secure client portal with the following technologies and features:
1.	Encrypted email and or text notification of new documents.  No document attachments allowed, just a timely method to notify clients they have documents to review.
2.	Secure client portal with multi-factor authentication process with comprehensive password policies.
3.	Client portal must have features:
a.	Encrypted data likely AES.
b.	Custom file permissions, read only, deleting, editing etc.
c.	Audit and version controls, where activity is timestamped in reports, and files can be restored through version history.
d.	eSignature capabilities.
e.	Data policy, how long sensitive data is available for the client, backup and disaster recovery, security breaches
Questions to ask to further refine this proposal:
1.	What are the cost restrictions or budget requirements?
2.	A company hosted server, a cloud-based solution, a service provider solution?
3.	Will clients be required to upload files?
4.	Will mobile flexibility be required for clients?
5.	What kind of sensitive data will be shared documents only? Video, audio?
